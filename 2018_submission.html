                                            Nostalgia and Memory in Spirited Away,” technically does not require a
                                            previous understanding of the movie or of any Japanese terms as the author
                                            goes in detail about most of the concepts. However, there are instances
                                            where the author does not and having seen the movie and knowing basic
                                            Japanese is quite beneficial. This can be seen in the abstract where the
                                            author first acknowledges Spirited Away in its original language as Sen to
                                            Chihiro no Kamikakushi (lit. Sen and Chihiro’s Spiriting Away). The author
                                            of this article is Alistair Swale from the University of Waikato in New
                                            Zealand; the publishing of this work was done by the Asian Studies
                                            Association of Australia in 2015. The main purpose of this article, and as
                                            quoted from the abstract, is that it “critically engages with the leading
                                            commentaries on nostalgia and memory in Miyazaki’s work” (Swale
                                            413).<br><br>Throughout the article, Swale prefaces this idea of nostalgia
                                            as a question whether to be answered or not. Miyazaki’s work was first
                                            contrasted with Susan Napier’s understanding of nostalgia, which was the
                                            mournful side of nostalgia. If the idea lacked the emotions of sadness and
                                            mourning, it can’t be compared to nostalgia because of the word’s ambiguity.
                                            Swale ties this to the Japanese phrase of “natsukashii” in the article.
                                            However, like many Japanese phrases, it can’t be fully translated. It is
                                            often read as nostalgic, but it can be interpreted in both positive and
                                            negative ways. Miyazaki’s work was then analyzed under Thomas Lamarre’s
                                            definition of nostalgia. Lamarre looked at nostalgia in film through the use
                                            of technique. The flatness and weightlessness with a considerable amount of
                                            visual jitter is how nostalgia is portrayed in cel animation. Almost
                                            disregarding Lamarre, Swale points focus on R.G. Collingwood, and this idea
                                            of magic. Collingwood described magic as a mutual understanding between
                                            culture and emotion. Utilizing the many definitions of nostalgia, Swale
                                            concluded the article by showcasing the most nostalgic scene in the movie
                                            and how it was able to show aspects pertaining to each of the definitions of
                                            nostalgia.<br><br>There are many instances in this article where Swale uses
                                            logos. On page 413, Swale mentions how it is nearly impossible to recreate a
                                            historical past or a personal experience precisely and follows up with the
                                            fact that “any kind of authentic engagement is impossible and that all
                                            attempts to engage with the past are doomed to register as sentimental
                                            fantasy and pastoralism” (Swale 414). Although it is not possible, the
                                            article begins to describe Miyazaki as a culturist. This sentimental
                                            fantasy, or better known as nostalgia, is “a means to reclaim a lost past –
                                            an attempt to retrieve something essential to Japanese culture” (Swale 414).
                                            Swale neglects to mention that this has been very true for a few animated
                                            films of the past two decades. In the pre-2000s, there was Grave of the
                                            Fireflies and in 2016, In This Corner of the World. Both depict a “lost
                                            past” of Japanese culture since they revolve around the quintessential
                                            moment before World War II and the bombing of two cities.&nbsp;To complement
                                            this, Swale, through Napier’s definition of nostalgia, comments, “With [My
                                            Neighbor Totoro]’s scrupulous attention to the architecture and landscape of
                                            prewar Japan, this film has one of the most explicit traits of replicating a
                                            past world now gone” (Swale 416). On the contrary, it seems that nostalgia
                                            does not always relate to a loss and instead, “Miyazaki’s preoccupation is
                                            not so much with ‘loss’ but with evoking a ‘world’, one that in fact
                                            transcends a particular time and space” (Swale 416). With this comes the
                                            idea of defamiliarisation, and Swale, through Napier, considers this
                                            contradictory to nostalgia, where it should be an engagement of the
                                            familiar. In all consideration, according to Napier, Spirited Away is not an
                                            homage to local culture but instead a general engagement of Japan’s past.
                                            Swale now analyzes Miyazaki’s work through the eyes of Thomas Lamarre.
                                            Lamarre is no simple person since he focuses on “the mechanics of cel
                                            animation as produced by the likes of Studio Ghibli, a bastion of dedication
                                            to the more traditionally rendered hand-drawn character design that is
                                            integrated into environments enhanced and embellished through 3D design”
                                            (Swale 419). In this, Lamarre sees how everything should be flat,
                                            weightless, and infer the passage of time in order to invoke nostalgia.
                                            Lamarre sees that Studio Ghibli is not embracing Japanese culture, and Swale
                                            takes note of it as his writing begins to be more biased against Lamarre.
                                            That’s for later though.<br><br>From Swale’s article, there was one moment
                                            where ethos struck me explicitly. During the Lamarre’s portion, Swale says,
                                            “Lamarre is not preoccupied with the authenticity or otherwise of the
                                            content” (Swale 420). This is quite interesting since there are some critics
                                            out there that will immediately claim that this anime is bad without seeing
                                            the context or the film for one second. It’s almost like favoritism. The
                                            usage of Lamarre, albeit criticizing Miyazaki, is quite important on the
                                            technique and content side of this article.<br><br>Swale showed pathos quite
                                            early on. Upon further reading, every moment that nostalgia is shown or
                                            spoken of, can be considered to be pathos. Although it seems that the source
                                            of pathos is told as a discussion of emotions, when reading, I felt a fair
                                            amount passion behind the engagement of different ideas. Swale claims,
                                            “Nostalgia in Spirited Away also works as a pure aesthetic category,
                                            generating pleasure in and of itself through momentary evocations of the
                                            mundane” (Swale 418). This can be complemented by Swale’s later comments of
                                            the movie’s later half. Swale mainly talks about the scene where Chihiro
                                            boards a train with No-Face or Kaonashi in the article. In that trip, Swale
                                            depicted the many parts that can be used as examples of nostalgia. A two
                                            carriage train meant rural, and white conductor gloves pay homage to the
                                            Japanese population. In the end, Swale says, “It is a scene that engages
                                            nostalgic content of a minute and intensely personal kind” (Swale 427). This
                                            is where Collingwood’s “magic” comes in. This sense of magic, as Swale
                                            mentions, is one that transcends culture.<br><br><br><br>Maybe there was a
                                            limited amount of kairos, because I didn’t see it being heavily used by
                                            Swale. When I did, it was usually as snappy remarks to excerpts prior. In
                                            Susan Napier’s portion, there was an excerpt where Napier states that in
                                            Japan, there is a lyrical sense of mourning present in anime and live-action
                                            films. Swale immediately highlights this lyrical sense as a mixed ordeal.
                                            “The term ‘natsukashii’, often translate as ‘nostalgic’, provides some clues
                                            to this” (Swale 415). A following excerpt has Napier stating that the term
                                            “natsukashii” is not translatable. Swale follows-up, still with the mixed
                                            concept, that nostalgia does not need to be about mourning, but instead “it
                                            can signify intense pleasure at the thought of a reconnection or a
                                            reawakening of a pleasant set of mental associations” (Swale
                                            415-16).<br><br>There are mentions of bias, but it seems more like passive
                                            aggressiveness towards one another. In this instance, it would be Lamarre.
                                            Lamarre has pointed out many problems with cel animation. The fact that it
                                            is flat, without weight, and requires a fair amount of work to replicate the
                                            motion of time. On page 422, Swale sees that Lamarre is intrigued to why
                                            there is this persistent use of cel when 3D is available. The problem is
                                            that Miyazaki is a staunch cel user. Every frame is hand drawn. There is
                                            nothing bad about it, but from a business’s perspective, there are
                                            limitations like time, cost, and final product. That seems to be in line
                                            with what Lamarre is thinking. With this, Swale pokes at Lamarre’s train of
                                            thought and explains that “[Anime Machine, Lamarre] is not at all clear [on]
                                            how it ‘thinks’ nostalgia in specific instances” (Swale 427). In other
                                            words, nostalgia should not and could not be determined by artistic
                                            technique alone.<br><br>Some parts of the article were unclear or felt
                                            misconstrued and were open for further discussion. On page 414, Swale
                                            referenced Stuart Tannock on how nostalgia has changed its connotation over
                                            the past two decades from a negative quality to one that is akin to the
                                            positive appreciation by society and culture. Since I had no prior
                                            understanding of film theory circa 1990, it was not easy to understand. On
                                            page 415, as quoted from Swale, “Spirited Away, given its rather distinctive
                                            treatment of nostalgia and identity, provides an appropriate vehicle to
                                            demonstrate the analytical utility of this more emphatically aesthetic
                                            approach” (Swale 415). Having seen some of Miyazaki’s other works, I was
                                            really wondering what “distinctive treatment” this movie got. Spirited Away
                                            got the same strong heroine treatment as My Neighbor Totoro and even
                                            Princess Mononoke. The only thing I see different in Spirited Away is the
                                            hint of a darker message. Swale could have done some more explaining here.
                                            On page 422, Swale claims, “The fact is that both animators and filmmakers
                                            in Japan have remained less inclined to fetishise photorealism or action
                                            ‘realism’, and are relatively comfortable with framing and movement that at
                                            times even overtly clash with cinematic realism more conventionally
                                            understood” (Swale 422). Yes, I did use the word “claim” here. There are
                                            problems with this claim since there have been countless moments of realism
                                            that occur in anime. Since this paper was published in 2015, animated works
                                            before 2014 should be fair when arguing about this. In 2014, P.A. Works came
                                            out with Shirobako. This anime was an homage to the animation industry. It
                                            was literally an anime about the insides of the industry. If that is not
                                            “real” enough, there was Makoto Shinkai’s 5 Centimeters per Second from
                                            2007. Many people have taken scenes from that movie and compared it to their
                                            real-life counterparts, and it was almost line for line. That’s just to
                                            counter the photorealism part. For the action “realism,” I will be focusing
                                            on body actions. The best example has to be from any of Naoko Yamada’s work.
                                            K-On, for example, features a scene where all the main characters run
                                            together in motion. It is not normal motion, but it is the motion of a
                                            person’s center of mass moving about. When looked from a different
                                            perspective, it is a human walking but animated with such realism. On page
                                            424, Swale says, “Miyazaki’s impact on both the Japanese and non-Japanese
                                            audiences, where he succeeds in facilitating precisely such an imaginative
                                            engagement regardless of the cultural specifics” (Swale 424). Swale forgot
                                            the fact that Studio Ghibli did land a deal with Disney and with that came
                                            dubbing sequences for the films. This points to the reason to why other
                                            anime films do not do as well, and Swale did not mention this.<br><br>This
                                            article posed one question for me. Why this movie? I’m not saying that
                                            Spirited Away is a bad movie. It is that there are so many other films that
                                            might be better at evoking nostalgia. There is Grave of the Fireflies for
                                            pre-WWII, 5 Centimeters per Second for distant relationships, and The Anthem
                                            of the Heart which pays homage to a lot of childhood stories. Since Swale
                                            needed movies before 2015, I do understand. Most of the more controversial
                                            yet nostalgic films came out in 2016. Other than that, even watching
                                            Spirited Away over the weekend, I see that sometimes nostalgia comes in
                                            discrete, tiny forms. It seems normal from one’s views, but with further
                                            analysis like Swale, it is an homage or a scene of
                                            nostalgia.<br><br><strong>Work Cited</strong><br>Swale, Alistair. “Miyazaki
